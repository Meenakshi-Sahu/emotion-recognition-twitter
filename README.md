Emotion classification from tweets using NLP and ML
# Emotion Detection from Text using NLP

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting human emotions from textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The goal is to classify text into different emotion categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and others, based on the emotional content expressed in the text.

## Dataset

* The dataset consists of labeled text samples with associated emotion classes.
* Each text input represents a short sentence or tweet expressing an emotion.
* The dataset was preprocessed before model training to improve performance.

## Approach

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Lowercasing
   * Removal of punctuation and unnecessary characters
   * Tokenization and text cleaning

2. **Feature Extraction**

   * Conversion of text into numerical form using NLP techniques
   * Vectorization for model input

3. **Model Training**

   * Machine learning models trained on processed text data
   * Performance evaluated using standard classification metrics

4. **Evaluation**

   * Accuracy and other relevant metrics used to assess model performance
   * Comparison of results across different approaches

## Results

* The trained model is able to effectively classify emotions from text.
* Results indicate strong performance in identifying common emotional categories.

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Google Colab (for experimentation)

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook file.
2. Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.
3. The final cells display the model performance and predictions.

## Notes

This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes and showcases the application of NLP techniques to emotion recognition tasks.
